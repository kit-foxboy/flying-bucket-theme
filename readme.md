# Flying Bucket 🚀

*Code with style the Kit way - stupid and gay*

## About

Inspired by the "legendary" airship of the same name, now you too can command a flying auroran junkyard of the highest caliber! Picture yourself piloting a sleek craft through electric blue nebulae, with holographic displays casting ethereal glows across brushed metal surfaces and holographic panels. Now powered by Matugen since I actually have no grasp of color theory whatsoever!

## Applications
- Visual Studio Code Theme
- BetterDiscord Theme (Translucence Adaptation)

## Color Palette

- **Chill Blue**: Relaxed blue for large bodies of text
- **Silver Edge**: For that extra pop for important highlights and icons
- **Neon Yellow**: Highlighting syntax and active tabs like holographic displays
- **Void Black**: The endless space between the stars
- **Custom Artwork**: Designed to compliment the included wallpaper by Kitfox Crimson
- **Cool frosted glass effect**: For the BetterDiscord theme, enhancing the sci-fi aesthetic
- **Gentle glowing accents**: Mimicking the soft illumination of holographic controls
- **Matugen-inspired colors**: A fresh take on the original Flying Bucket palette, balanced to be more readable and visually appealing

## Captain's Log

*"Space. The Final Fantasy 7. These are the voyages of The Flying Bucket. Its continuing mission: to make neat things and catch fire no more than 60% of the time when hitting the ignition."*

Happy coding, ace pilot! 🚀
