# Flying Bucket 🚀

*Code with style the Kit way - stupid and gay*

## About

Inspired by the "legendary" airship of the same name, now you too can command a flying auroran junkyard of the highest caliber! Picture yourself piloting a sleek craft through electric blue nebulae, with holographic displays casting ethereal glows across brushed metal surfaces and holographic panels.

## Color Palette

- **Chill Blue**: Relaxed blue for large bodies of text
- **Silver Edge**: For that extra pop for important highlights and icons
- **Neon Yellow**: Highlighting syntax and active tabs like holographic displays
- **Void Black**: The endless space between the stars
- **Custom Artwork**: Designed to compliment the included wallpaper by Kitfox Crimson

*"Space. The Final Fantasy 7. These are the voyages of The Flying Bucket. Its continuing mission: to make neat things and catch fire no more than 60% of the time when hitting the ignition."*

Happy coding, ace pilot! 🚀
