# Flying Bucket 🚀

*Code with style the Kit way - stupid and gay*

## About

Inspired by the "legendary" airship of the same name, now you too can command a flying auroran junkyard of the highest caliber! Picture yourself piloting an exotic alien craft through electric blue nebulae, with holographic displays casting ethereal glows across brushed metal surfaces with a mix of ancient and modern technology. Now powered by Matugen since I actually have no grasp of color theory whatsoever!

## Applications
- Visual Studio Code Theme
- Zed (ie. Better VsCode) Theme
- BetterDiscord Theme (Translucence Adaptation)

## Color Palette

- **Chill Blue**: Relaxed blue for large bodies of text
- **Silver Edge**: For that extra pop for important highlights and icons
- **Void Black**: The endless space between the stars
- **Custom Artwork**: Designed to compliment the included wallpaper by Kitfox Crimson
- **Cool frosted glass effect**: For the BetterDiscord and Zed themes, enhancing the sci-fi aesthetic
- **Gentle glowing accents**: Mimicking the soft illumination of holographic controls
- **Matugen-inspired colors**: A fresh take on the original Flying Bucket palette, balanced to be more readable and visually appealing at the cost of the neon yellow.

## Features

✨ Easy on the eyes during those late-night coding sessions
🛸 Optimized contrast for maximum readability on translucent windows (e.g. Hyprland)
⚡ Syntax highlighting that makes code feel alive
🌌 Dark theme with a gentle contrast
🎨 Custom artwork to set the mood
🖥️ System76's Cosmic Desktop Environment ready so doesn't look quite as faded on opaque windows
🍬 Goes great with the sweet vscode icon pack by Eliver Lara

## Installation
### VS Code
Launch VS Code Quick Open (Ctrl+P), paste the following command, and press enter:

```
ext install kit-kabbit.flying-bucket
```

### BetterDiscord
Launch BetterDiscord Settings, navigate to Themes, and click "Open Theme Folder". Place the downloaded theme file into this folder, then enable it in the BetterDiscord settings.

### Zed
Open Zed and hit `Ctrl+Shift+P` to open the command palette, then type `Install Dev Extension` and select the downloaded theme file. Alternatively, you can drag and drop the theme file into the Zed config folder. This is where you can find the config folder:

```
# On Linux
~/.config/zed/

# On Windows
%APPDATA%\Zed\config

# On macOS (I think anyway, might need to double check this at some point)
~/Library/Application Support/Zed/config
```
